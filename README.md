# Analysis Papers
This repository is home to a number of papers that I have drafted whilst bring in the process of learning the mathematics behind General Relativity. At present all the papers are in the latex.

I am a Chartered Engineer and so I do this as a hobby. Therefore, many things could be amiss in these papers and I update them as I learn (or need to learn) more.

There is a separate section for more calculus specific pages. If it makes little sense to separate I will merge in the future.

The general principle is that I as I need to learn about an aspect of the mathematics I add a learning paper.

If there is anything constructive you wish to add then please feel free to join in. I can be contacted on <paul@the-valentines.co.uk>.
