# Taylor Series
Simple derivation of the Taylor Series expansion.

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{n=\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n
$$
This expansion is useful in approximating single variable functions local to a point.

These are breif papers that I use to compile my learning. Hosted here as a record with 'warts and all'

I am an Engineer by profession so use of such analytical tools is standard. Nevertheless, the more mathematical side to these papers is generated from a pure love of mathermatical physics. There is no guarantee of accuracy.
